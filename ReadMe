# Customized ChatBot

**Developing a Customized ChatBot Using OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

This project demonstrates the development of a customized ChatBot leveraging OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The goal is to enhance the chatbot's capabilities by integrating external knowledge sources, allowing it to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
