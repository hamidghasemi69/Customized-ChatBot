# Customized ChatBot

**Developing a Customized ChatBot Using OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

This project demonstrates the development of a customized ChatBot leveraging OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The goal is to enhance the chatbot's capabilities by integrating external knowledge sources, allowing it to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Project Overview

- **`Objective`**: Build a customized ChatBot that utilizes OpenAI's LLMs and a RAG mechanism to provide enhanced conversational abilities.
- **`Dataset`**: Utilizes a curated set of documents and knowledge sources to augment the chatbot's responses.
- **`Framework`**: Built using Python, OpenAI's API, and relevant libraries for data retrieval and processing.
- **`Integration`**: Combines LLMs with external knowledge sources to improve response accuracy and relevance.

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/hamidghasemi69/Customized-ChatBot.git`
   
   `cd Customized-ChatBot`


2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   `jupyter notebook Custom-ChatBot-OpenAI.ipynb`

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the environment, load documents, initialize the RAG mechanism, and interact with the customized ChatBot.
